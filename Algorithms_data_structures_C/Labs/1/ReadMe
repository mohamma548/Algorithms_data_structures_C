Data abstraction and procedure abstraction
Write a program, that first reads the starting time (hours and minutes) of a
certain process and then the ending time of the same process

sub tasks
1) read time
2) check whether of the given time is earlier (extra feature, not mandatory)
3) calculate time difference
4) display the time.

Extra additional feature
To make time more generic and better reusable in possible other projects write an
additional function compare_times that uses the same concept than standard C string
comparison function compare in the sense that the function returns -1, if time1 is
earlier than time2. The function returns 0 if times are equal and it return 1 if time1 is
later than time2.
